1) Simulation- usually animation from data and other CLASSICAL physics problems(this mainly involves solving differential equation of the respective problems)
2) Numerical methods (optimizing algorithms and many other used in machine learning and solving differential equations)
3) Solving equations(usually differential equations or a system of equations or maybe sometimes integration) in python
